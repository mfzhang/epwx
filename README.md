EPwx - sparse PCA using EP
==========================

Introduction
------------

Matlab code for Bayesian sparse principal component analysis with Gaussian and/or probit likelihoods and spike and slab sparse prior. Inference methods:

 * Expectation propagation (EP),
 * Hybrid variational bayes - EP (VB-EP),
 * Gibbs sampling.

Warning: The code is not "production quality".

Installation
------------

EP and Gibbs sampling use C++ code, which needs to be compiled in Matlab using mex. The code requires [Eigen matrix library][Eigen]. Eigen doesn't require any installation: just download and unzip it. To compile the C++ code, type in Matlab command line (after replacing "/path/to/eigen/" with the location of the unzipped Eigen library):

```
mex -largeArrayDims -I/path/to/eigen/ ep_wx_parallelep_factcov.cpp
mex CXXFLAGS="\$CXXFLAGS -std=c++0x" -largeArrayDims -I/path/to/eigen/ gibbs_wx_probit_half_normal_sampling_nomatlab.cpp
```

Changes
-------

2014-04-16 (first release)
 * The code has been slightly updated from the version used in the AISTATS2014 article, but should give similar results.
 * Minor updates to EP and VB-EP approximation initializations.
 * EP uses Newton iterations to refine the end-point for the numerical integration.
